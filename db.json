The traditional boxy SUV appearance of the Atlas is a clue to the amount of space available inside for three rows of seating and a family's worth of cargo. While the interior comes across as spartan compared with rivals such as the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, or Subaru Ascent, the standard feature and driver assistance list helps the Atlas shine in a segment abundant with value propositions. For our review, we took the extravagantly named SEL Premium R-Line 4Motion, which is only available with the V6 engine, for a week-long test drive. It tops out the range at a hefty price of $50,725, while the base model with the four-cylinder engine and front-wheel-drive starts at a much more affordable MSRP of $31,555.",

ERAD was designed to reduce CO2 emissions by an average of 20% under the NEDC test cycle and was expected to offer another 10% reduction in extra-urban driving situations while also optimising the off-road ability of the vehicle.
